  <header>Tutorials - </header>

  <h10><span id="top"></span></h10>
  <p>Here you will find an extensive set of tutorials on everything ranging from project management, to software development and electrical/mechanical design. The aim is to provide you with all the skills you need to perform outstanding research. </p>

  <h10><span id="prj_mgmt"></span></h10>
    <h3>Getting Started with this Site</h3>
    <p>It might be good to know how to use this site (particularly GitHub) before anything else!</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="tut/introToGit.html">Intro to GitHub</a></li>
    </ul>

  <h10><span id="prj_mgmt"></span></h10>
    <h3>Project Management</h3>
    <p>So you want to be a physicist... Well, no matter what you want to be when you grow up, good project management skills are important to your success. The project management tutorials are designed to help you learn the tools and skills that will help you build a truly great project. This means communication, collaboration, documentation, presentation, and more! </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="tut/introToProjMgmt.html">Intro to Project Management</a> - UNDER CONSTRUCTION - A broad overview of good project management practices, including advice and tips for getting started with your own project.</li>
      <li><a>Project Management Guidelines</a> - UNDER CONSTRUCTION - A specific set of guidelines to help you build a project that conforms with the standards that are encouraged on this site.</li>
      <li><a>Advanced Project Management </a> - COMING SOON - Tips for expanding your project to include things like build systems (cmake), documentation frameworks (doxygen), testing frameworks (gtest), and package distribution utilities (dpkg).</li>
    </ul>

  <h10><span id="sw_dev"></span></h10>
    <h3>Software</h3>
    <p>Whether you are planning to do pure theoretical physics, build a flying robot, or analyze data from ultra high-speed cameras, chances are you will need to develop some software to support your project. This could mean developing a computer simulation, writing firmware to interface with a motor controller, or performing real-time image analysis. The software tutorials are designed to help you learn tools and practices that will aid in the design and implementation of software.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="tut/historyOfLinux.html">History of GNU/Linux</a> - UNDER CONSTRUCTION - A (very) brief history of GNU/Linux.</li>
      <li><a >Installing Linux</a> - COMING SOON! - Learn how to install and configure our favorite linux distribution (Ubuntu).</li>
      <li><a >Intro to BASH</a> - COMING SOON! - Learn the basics of the popular BASH command shell. </li>
      <li><a >C++ Hello World</a> - COMING SOON! - learn how to write and compile your very own Hello World program in C/C++.</li>
    </ul>

  <h10><span id="hw_mech"></span></h10>
    <h3>Hardware/Mechanical</h3>
    <p>Many physics projects will require mechanical design work. The hardware and mechanical design tutorials will help you learn the tools you need to create modern designs using Computer Aided Design (CAD) software (see <a href="../resources/index.html#cad_programs">Resources</a> for a list of recommended CAD programs).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="tut/introToInventor11/index.html">Intro to AutoDesk Inventor '11</a></li>
    </ul>
    
  <h10><span id="elec"></span></h10>
    <h3>Electrical</h3>
    <p>Electrical design is an important aspect of nearly any modern physics project. The electrical design tutorials will help you learn the tools and design principles required to create working electronic devices, embedded circuit boards, etc..</p>
