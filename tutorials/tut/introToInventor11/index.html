<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>AutoDesk Inventor is a widely used and very powerful computer-aided design software suite that shows you pretty pictures of intricate engines and turbines on the load-up screen, then crushes your dreams when you realize the only thing you know how to make is an extruded square.
<br>
We will attempt to show you the ropes of getting started with Inventor and clearifying any confusing terminology that the app throws your way. But first, the prerequisits:</p>

<!--BOOKMARK--><h10><span id="prereqs"></span></h10>
<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
<p>This tutorial is written assuming you have a functional copy of "AutoDesk Inventor Professional 2011 - Student Edition" operating on a Windows machine. If you find yourself without Inventor, visit the "CAD Programs" heading on the <a href="../../../resources/index.html">Resources Page</a> to download it.</p>

<!--BOOKMARK--><h10><span id="basics"></span></h10>
<h2>The Basics:</h2>
<p>First let's define some vocabulary:</p>
<p class="hangingIndent"><i>Sketch</i>: A series of boundaries, points, etc. that designate an origin for a feature, such as an extrusion, hole, or surface. (e.g. drill sites for mounting holes can be marked on a surface using "points" in a sketch.) <br> <text class="finePrint"><u>Note</u>: Sketches can be two or three dimensional.</text></p>
<p class="hangingIndent"><i>Constraint</i>: In a Sketch or Assembly, rules that define the position/orientation of features/parts with respect to other features/parts. <br> <text class="finePrint"><u>Note</u>: Inventor occasionally provides guides that indicate common constraint options, such as placing a line tangent to a circle. However, these suggestions do not constrain a feature until a constraint is deliberately set.</text></p>
<p class="hangingIndent"><i>Part</i>: In its simplest form, a single component, perhaps to be integrated into an assembly.</p>
<p class="hangingIndent"><i>Assembly</i>: A collection of parts with interdependent constraints that define a configuration to make a system. Assemblies may include assemblies to create larger assemblies.</p>

<!--BOOKMARK--><h10><span id="lessons"></span></h10>
<h2>Lessons and Instructional Guides:</h2><hr>
<p style="margin-bottom:25px;">Here are a few short guides to get you acquainted with Inventor and its quriks - For the first three lessons, we'll use Inventor to make a tank for Dr. Semak:
<br>
<a href="#sketches">Sketches</a> - From 2D Profiles...
<br>
<a href="#parts">Parts</a> - ...to 3D Objects...
<br>
<a href="#assemblies">Assemblies</a> - ...to Integrated Systems (of destruction)!
<br>
<a href="#other">Other Stuff</a> - Explore (aka. Dare you to break it!)
<br>
<a href="../../../resources/inventorQuickRef.html">Quick Reference Guide</a> - Cheat sheet from the References page
</p>

<h3>"Sketches"</h3>
<table class="figureright" align="right" width="260px">
		<tr><td class="figure"><img src="images/HyperWalchOid.png"></td></tr>
		<tr><th class="figure">Figure 1</th></tr>
		<tr><td class="figure"> A Hyperwalchoid</td></tr>
</table>
<p>From Sketches, come Parts. The body of a Part is typically made up of a series of extrusions that are created from a Sketch. For example, an extruded rectangle creates a rectangular prism, an extruded circle creates a cylindar, and an extruded Dr. Walch gives a hyperwalchoid <b>(Figure 1)</b>.</p>
<p>Before we start our tank, let's have a quick crash-course on "Sketch drawing". First, let's draw a square centered about the origin. After selecting the "rectangle" button <img height="14px" align="bottom" src="images/inventorButtons/draw_rectangle.png"> click to mark the first vertex of a the rectangle and its diagonal vertex. You may notice that the cursor can stick to the center point, or to dotted lines on the X/Y axes. I want to stress that, regardless of the sketch component, these guides are not consistantly permanent and may not lock your feature to a location (and sometimes it locks it when you don't want it to! Careful!). This isn't a big deal now, but keep in mind my points about "constraints" <b>(Figure 2)</b> as I go over them.</p>
<table class="figureleft" align="left" width="260px">
		<tr><td class="figure"><img src="images/inventorButtons/constraints.png"></td></tr>
		<tr><th class="figure">Figure 2</th></tr>
		<tr><td class="figure"> Sketch Constrains Panel</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="figure" style="font-size:8pt;"> Hover over each icon (in Inventor) to preview the constraint's function.</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-top:0px;">I want to center this rectangle permanently, without relying on the guides. To do this, I need to mark the center of the rectangle. Make another rectangle off to the side of the first. Now we need to use constraints to make this a construction reference. Highlight the second rectangle and press the construction icon <img height="20px" align="top" src="images/inventorButtons/format_construction.png"> (this indicates that the line is a referece and not a boundary for a Part feature).</p>
<table class="figureright" align="right" width="400px">
		<tr><td class="figure"><iframe width="350" height="197" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JzMgYbhfmCc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></td></tr>
		<tr><th class="figure">Figure 3</th></tr>
		<tr><td class="figure"> Centered Rectangle</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Now, using the coincidence constraint <img height="20px" align="top" src="images/inventorButtons/constrain_coincidence.png">, constrain one corner of the first rectangle to a corner of the second. Finally, use the symmetry button <img height="20px" align="top" src="images/inventorButtons/constrain_symmetric.png"> to place the sides of the first rectangle symmetrically about the remaining side of the reference rectangle <b>(Figure 3)</b>. This mirrors the first two lines you click around the third line that you click (you can also do this for points). To do the vertical lines, hit [escape] and repeat.</p>

<p class="finePrint">*A very important detail that comes with experience is Sketch placement. Taking advantage of the part's origin and axes can be helpful in completing symmetry, for example.</p>
