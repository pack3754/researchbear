<h2>Overview:</h2>

<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> If you want to perform physics research at the undergraduate level, you are going to have to step up and learn what it takes to manage a successful project.  </p>

<p> This means finding an advisor who shares your interesets <em>and</em> making an effort to communicate with them about your project and any problems you run into along the way. It means collaborating with fellow students who may be working on similar or related topics. It means documenting and organizing your project files and systems so that future students will be able to appreciate what you have created, and even be able to pick up where you left off. It means communicating your results in a convincing and meaningful way! Scheduling, long-term planning... The list goes on.</p>


<p>If this all sounds "preachy" to you... good! It's meeant to be a bit of a kick in the pants. You are ultimately responsible for your project.</p>

<p>In the beginning, you may feel like "project management" is just code for "a lot of extra work", but in the long run - learning the right tools and using the resources that are available to you will make everything go much more smoothly! Trust us,all of these skills and tools will be incredibly useful when you enter (*gasp*) the real world.</p>

<p>Now, get to work!</p>

<h3>Choosing Your Advisor:</h3>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://http://www.unco.edu/nhs/physics/faculty/index.html">faculty</a> page to learn more about your professors.</p>
<p>Choosing your advisor is one of the most important aspects of embarking on new research project. Your choice can have a significant effect on whether you have an awesome experience, or a mediocre one. There are about a million factors in choosing your advisor.. For example: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you like them? 
    <ul> <li>Their personality?</li>
      <li>Their teaching style?</li>
      <li>Their bad jokes?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do you share any research interests?</li>
  <li>Are they super busy all the time, or hard to get a hold of?</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you wondering how you can even start to answer these questions??? Well here are some suggestions: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Take a class from them.</li>
  <li>Swing by during their office hours.</li>
  <li>Read their online profiles.</li>
  <li>Ask other students their opinions.</li>
  <li>Draw straws.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is: choosing your advisor can be a tough choice, but one that you should consider carefully.</p>
