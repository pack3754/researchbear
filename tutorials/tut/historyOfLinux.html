<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>This page primarily provides a historical background for the GNU/Linux operating systems. To get started using Linux - see  <a href="installingLinux.html">Installing Linux</a> and <a href="introToBASH.html">Intro to BASH</a></p>
<p>In the beginning, there was Unix...</p>
<p>Actually - a lot happened before Unix came along, but the coming of Unix marked an important moment in computer history, because the Unix operating system model has become the basis for a whole family of operating systems and computing standards that are very popular in scientific and embedded computing. One of the offshoots of Unix, GNU (that is a clever acronym for 'GNU is NOt Unix'... pronounced Guh-Noo, that is, the G is NOT silent) has developed in the idea of "free" software.. "Free" software in the GNU sense doesn't necessarily mean free of charge, but it does mean free to read and modify. GNU's tagline is sometimes: "free" as in "free speech", not as in "free beer". </p>

<p>The significance of this approach to computer systems is that it allows the user (you) to learn and understand what is going on behind the scenes, and (if it suits you) to modify the system itself. As you begin developing your own software, it helps tremendously to have access to a massive library of example code, and a supportive community of developers. </p>

<p>When people share ideas and information, beautiful things can happen.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
You should obtain a Linux-based OS, for example Ubuntu, and try it out! There are many tutorials out there on the webs to help you get started. See the resources page for a link to our personal favorite (Ubuntu).

<h2>Details:</h2>
<p>In the early days of GNU, there was one major stumbling block to the fledgling "free software" movement. The kernel (the core of the operating system, the piece that talks to hardware, schedules processes, etc) being used was a proprietary piece of software that was under strict licensing restrictions. What they really needed was to develop the OS from the ground up, beginning with this critical piece of software known as the kernel. Two factions rose to meet the challenge - one group headed by Richard Stallman</p>
