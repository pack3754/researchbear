      <p>Welcome to <em>Research Bear</em>, a website - for science!!!</p>
      <p> If you're thinking about starting a research project, it's your lucky day! This site was created to provide students of the physical sciences with a set of tools, tutorials, and guidelines to aid in their research projects.</p>
      
      <p> In the future, we hope to provide a wider range of resources to aid students in a variety of fields, but for now the rest of you are out of luck. Learn more details about the goals of Research Bear on the <a href="construction.html">About</a> page.</p>

      <p>At this point, you may be wondering: "What's this site all about, anyway? Why am I here?? Who's pants are these???" To answer those questions, here's a video of a bear in a stream:</p>

        <p>Now that everything's cleared up, buckle up and get ready for some tough love from Research Bear and his faithful sidekick, Ashamed Man!</p>

        <aside id="ashamedman_says"><em>
          <b>Ashamed Man</b> says -</em><p>"Start your research early and work hard, or you'll end up like me... sad and alone."</p>
        </aside>

        <p>Wondering where to go next?? Well as a student of the physical sciences it is your <em>responsibility</em> to be up to date on all of the nerdiest web-comics (e.g. <a href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>, <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/">SMBC</a>, and <a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/">Abstruse Goose</a>).</p>

        <p>Once you've spent a few hours catching up with those web-comics, pull on your "big boy pants" and get ready to move on to the rest of the site! Select one of the following options, or tour the site using the "Navigation Bar" overhead:</p>
